I am a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at the University of New Hampshire, working with [Prof John F Gibson](https://ceps.unh.edu/person/john-gibson) on transition to turbulence in shear flows. Prior to this, I was an MS student at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru, India. I worked with [Prof Alam](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/meheboob/) at JNCASR on pattern formation in compressible Taylor-Couette flow. I obtained a BE(Hons.) in mechanical engineering from BITS Pilani, India.

An overarching theme of my research so far is pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics of rotating, stratified and/or sheared flows. I am also interested in scientific computation, bifurcation theory and symmetry breaking. In future, I would like to explore applications of these ideas in geophysical and/or biological contexts.
