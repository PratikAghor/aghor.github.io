I am working with Remil Mushtaq, a fellow grad student at UNH, investigating the effect of thermal stratification on porous plane Couette flow. We consider Darcy-Brinkman for flow through porous media for imposing no-slip boundary conditions. For the same set of other external parameters such as the constant Rayleigh number (Ra), Brinkman-Prandtl number (RB) and Darcy-Prandlt number (or inverse Vadaz number) RD, we are able to prove that Squire's theorem holds, i.e., spanwise-independent 2d disturbances are sufficient to find the critical Reynolds number (Re). We consider extremely low Prandtl number flows ($$Pr \sim O(10^{-6})$$) found in stellar interiors. We report the linear stability thresholds (critical Reynolds numbers $$Re_c$$) for the reduced two-dimensional system. This paper will be submitted soon to the Physical Review Fluids.
