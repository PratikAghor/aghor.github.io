I am working with Remil Mushtaq, a fellow grad student at UNH, investigating the effect of shear on the classical porous media convection. In order to include shear and hence impose no-slip boundary conditions on the walls, we considered Darcy-Brinkman extension of the classic Darcy's law. We recently started working on the problem and are already getting some interesting results.
