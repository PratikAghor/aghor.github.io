Edge of chaos is the boundary betweeen basins of attractions of laminar and turbulent flows. The exact nonlinear solutions of the governing Navier-Stokes equations that live on this edge-manifold are known as 'edge states'. They have only one unstable direction, perturbed one way, the flow decays back to the laminar state, perturbed the other way, the flow is sucked into the turbulent attractor. We found some interesting behaviour of edge states of plane Poiseuille flow. Prof. Gibson and I are currently working on an article based on this work that will be submitted to the Physical Review Fluids (PRF).
