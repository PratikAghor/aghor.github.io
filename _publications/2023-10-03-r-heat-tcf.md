### Summary:
Taylorâ€“Couette flow (TCF) refers to the annular flow between two concentric, differentially rotating cylinders. After [Taylor's seminal 1923 article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1923.0008), the topic remains an active research area even today after a centrury due to its experimental simplicity and a wide range of applications. 

This work adds to the current literature on the radially heated TCF. Some key results of this paper are summarized below. 
* We find unstable modes in the Rayleigh stable region of the parameter space. 
* We generalize previously identified symmetries of the linear problem to the case of rotating outer cylinder. 
* We locate instability islands also known as closed disconnected neutral curves (CDNCs) for a number of parameters.
* We show by example that CDNCs are sensitive to changes in the rotation rate ratio and their appearance or disappearance can induce discontinous jumps in the critical Taylor number.

### Personal notes:

This paper is special to me for two principal reasons --

(i)  It comes in the year 2023, the hudrenth anniversary of [Taylor's seminal 1923 article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1923.0008). It's a personal hat-tip to Taylor's inspiring work.
(ii) I worked with a long time friend [Mohammad Atif](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dMnfPA0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), currently a postdoc at the Brookhaven National Labs, NY. It was really fun working together.
