Taylor–Couette flow (TCF) refers to the annular flow between two concentric, differentially rotating cylinders. After [Taylor's seminal 1923 article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1923.0008), the topic remains an active research area even today after a centrury due to its experimental simplicity and a wide range of applications. In this work, the asymmetric 2-roll modes (called the single-roll or ‘anomalous’ modes), that break the midplane  $$Z_2$$-symmetry, are uncovered at $$\Gamma \leq O(1)$$, where $$\Gamma = h/ \delta $$ is the aspect ratio with $$h$$ being the height of the cylinders and $$\delta$$ being the gap width. The phase boundaries of both symmetric and asymmetric rolls and the coexisting regions of different number of rolls are identified in the $$(\Gamma , Re )$$-plane, where $$Re$$ is the inner Reynolds number. We were able to show that the ‘$$1 \leftrightarrow 2$$’-roll transition in small aspect ratio cylinders is subcritical in compressible TCF in contrast to the supercritical nature of bifurcation in its incompressible counterpart. This work was published in the [Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/nonlinear-axisymmetric-taylorcouette-flow-in-a-dilute-gas-multiroll-transition-and-the-role-of-compressibility/B528D542F58FC12D8F666BA1207249FA).
