It is important to study the symmetries of a system because they influence dynamics and determine kinds of allowable solutions. We consider plane Poiseuille flow (PPF) driven by a constant bulk velocity constraint. We classify relevent symmetric subspaces of PPF and also compute traveling waves in a few of them, using the knowledge about symmetries to simplify numerical computations. I presented a poster based on this work at the Boulder Summer School 2022 - [bss_poster](http://pratikaghor.github.io/_pages/posters/aghor_symmetry_bss.pdf). Prof. Gibson and I are currently working on an article based on this work that will be submitted to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (JFM).
